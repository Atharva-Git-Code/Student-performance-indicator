## Student Performance Indicator

This machine learning project uses a dataset of 1000 students to predict academic performance based on parameters such as Race or Ethnicity, Parental Level of Education, Lunch Type, Gender, Writing Score, and Reading Score. The project involves preprocessing the data, training and evaluating supervised learning algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, and creating a dashboard or application to present the model's predictions. The project aims to provide valuable insights into the factors that influence student performance and help educators and policymakers to make informed decisions to improve student outcomes.


## Dataset

The data consists of 8 column and 1000 rows.

## Approach
Data Preprocessing:
The first step in any machine learning project is to explore and preprocess the dataset to ensure that the data is suitable for analysis. In this project, we will use data cleaning and preprocessing techniques to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data. We will also perform feature engineering to transform the raw data into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.

Supervised Learning Algorithms:
The next step in the project is to apply various supervised learning algorithms to the preprocessed data. These algorithms include Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. These algorithms will be trained and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to identify the best performing model.

Model Evaluation:
Once the best model is identified, we will evaluate the model using cross-validation techniques to ensure its robustness and prevent overfitting. Cross-validation is a technique that involves partitioning the dataset into multiple subsets, training the model on one subset, and evaluating it on the remaining subsets. This technique helps to ensure that the model's performance is not biased by the specific subset of data used for training.

Model Deployment:
The final output of the project will be a dashboard or an application that allows users to input the relevant parameters and obtain predictions about student performance. The dashboard will be designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, making it easy for users to interact with the model and understand its predictions. This dashboard will provide valuable insights into the factors that influence student performance and help educators and policymakers to make informed decisions about how to improve student outcomes.
